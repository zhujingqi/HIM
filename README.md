# HIM
## Introduction
**HIM, a simple coding language called Haha In Mind**

It only has 10 commands:
`ha he hah heh haha hahe hehe hahaha ho hoho`

Therefore, it's extremely easy to learn, but using it to write programs is extremely difficult (you'll understand later)
## Syntax
These `HIM` commands are explained in `C++`:

**`ha`** `mem[p]++;`

**`he`** `mem[p]--;`

**`hah`** `p++;`

**`heh`** `p--;`

**`haha`** `cout<<mem[p]<<" ";`

**`hahe`** `cout<<char(mem[p])<<" ";`

**`hehe`** `int v; cin>>v; mem[p]=v;`

**`hahaha`** `Set loop variable to current value`
