# HIM
## Introduction
**HIM, a simple coding language called Haha In Mind**

It only has 10 commands:
`ha he hah heh haha hahe hehe hahaha ho hoho`

Therefore, it's extremely easy to learn, but using it to write programs is extremely difficult (you'll understand later)
## Syntax
These `HIM` commands are explained in `C++`:

**`ha`** `mem[p]++;`

**`he`** `mem[p]--;`

**`hah`** `p++;`

**`heh`** `p--;`

**`haha`** `cout<<mem[p]<<" ";`

**`hahe`** `cout<<char(mem[p])<<" ";`

**`hehe`** `int v; cin>>v; mem[p]=v;`

**`hahaha`** Set loop variable to current value (`i=mem[p];`)

**`ho`** Start of a loop

**`hohoho`** End of a loop. While `i!=0`, go to the previous `ho` position and `--i;`.

**`hu`** `if(mem[p]==0)` then run codes between `hu` and `huhu`.

**`huhu`** End of the structure `hu...huhu`.

Ignore all characters except for those keywords above. (So you can write a HIM program in the middle of anything)
## Example
| Code | Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ha ha ha haha` | | 3 |
| `ha ha ha hahaha hah ho ha ha hoho haha` | | 6 |
| `hehe haha hahe` | 65 | 65 A |
| `hehe hu haha huhu` | 0 | 0 |
## Compiler
Download `him.exe` to compile your HIM program!

`him.cpp` is the source code of `him.exe`.

Enjoy programing and let your mind full of laughter!!!
## Extra
Useful tool: Use `textmaker.exe` to generate code that can output custom strings in the HIM language

## Simple HIM Program
`hellohim.txt`: Hello, HIM!

`ifelse.txt`: `cin>>a; if(a==0) cout<<0; else cout<<1;`

More HIM programs are coming soon...
